# Templatized Agent System

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the ledit agent architecture and a blueprint for creating simplified, configurable agent templates.

## Overview

The ledit project contains a sophisticated AI agent system that can be templatized to create simpler, more focused agents. The system features:

- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with CLI, agent workflows, tools, and LLM integration
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Support for complex workflows with multiple specialized agents
- **Tool System**: Pluggable tools with permissions and execution contexts
- **Configuration Management**: Domain-specific configuration with inheritance and overrides
- **Prompt Engineering**: Sophisticated prompt management with user customization
- **Workspace Integration**: Deep integration with development workspaces and file systems

## Architecture Analysis

### Core Components

The agent system is built around several key architectural patterns:

1. **Command Pattern**: CLI commands that encapsulate specific agent behaviors
2. **Workflow Pattern**: Sequential execution of agent tasks with state management
3. **Tool Pattern**: Pluggable tools with standardized interfaces
4. **Configuration Pattern**: Hierarchical configuration with domain-specific settings
5. **Context Pattern**: Persistent context management across agent sessions

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Simplified vs Complex Workflows
The system supports both simplified and complex agent workflows:
- **Simplified**: Direct execution with todo management
- **Complex**: Multi-agent orchestration with dependencies and coordination

#### 2. Tool-First Design
Tools are first-class citizens with:
- Standardized interfaces (`Tool` interface)
- Permission systems
- Execution contexts
- Category-based organization

#### 3. Configuration Hierarchy
Configuration follows a clear hierarchy:
- Global defaults
- Domain-specific configs (LLM, Agent, UI, Security)
- User overrides
- Runtime parameters

#### 4. State Management
Multiple levels of state management:
- Session-level context
- Agent execution state
- Tool execution results
- User interaction history

## Template Structure

The templatized agent should extract the following key components:

### 1. Core Agent Framework
- Agent lifecycle management
- Intent analysis and routing
- Todo/task management
- Execution orchestration

### 2. Tool System
- Tool registry and execution
- Built-in tools (file, shell, user interaction)
- Tool permissions and security
- Tool result handling

### 3. LLM Integration
- Provider abstraction
- Model configuration
- Token usage tracking
- Tool calling integration

### 4. Configuration System
- Hierarchical configuration
- Environment variable support
- Configuration validation
- Runtime overrides

### 5. Workspace Integration
- File system operations
- Workspace discovery
- Change tracking
- Build system integration

## Simplification Opportunities

### 1. Remove Complex Orchestration
The multi-agent orchestration system is powerful but complex. A simplified template could:
- Remove dependency management
- Simplify agent coordination
- Focus on single-agent workflows

### 2. Streamline Configuration
Simplify the configuration system by:
- Reducing domain-specific configs
- Using simpler configuration formats (YAML/JSON)
- Removing advanced features like model timeouts

### 3. Reduce Tool Complexity
Simplify the tool system by:
- Providing fewer built-in tools
- Simplifying tool interfaces
- Removing advanced permissions

### 4. Focus on Core Use Cases
Target specific use cases rather than being general-purpose:
- Code editing agents
- Documentation agents
- Testing agents
- Development workflow agents

## Template Design Principles

### 1. Configurable First
Make everything configurable through simple interfaces:
- Tool selection via configuration
- Goal specification via config
- Output format specification via config

### 2. Modular Components
Design components to be:
- Easily swappable
- Independently testable
- Configurable at runtime

### 3. Simple API Surface
Provide simple, intuitive APIs:
- Clear configuration interfaces
- Simple agent instantiation
- Easy tool registration

### 4. Extensible Architecture
Allow for easy extension:
- Plugin system for custom tools
- Custom agent behaviors
- Additional LLM providers
