# Test Author Workflow

Use this skill when adding or updating tests.

## Steps

1. Define expected behavior for changed code.
2. Add regression tests for known failure modes.
3. Add edge-case coverage for boundaries and errors.
4. Keep tests deterministic and fast.

## Required Output

- Test files added/updated
- Behaviors covered (happy path, edge, regression)
- Commands run and pass/fail summary
- Any untested risk still open
