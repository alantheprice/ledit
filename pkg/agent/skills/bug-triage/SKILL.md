# Bug Triage Workflow

Use this skill when debugging or handling bug reports.

## Steps

1. Reproduce the bug with a concrete command or test.
2. Isolate minimal failing scope (file/function/condition).
3. Identify root cause with direct evidence.
4. Propose smallest safe fix and verification plan.

## Required Output

- Reproduction steps and expected vs actual behavior
- Root cause statement with evidence
- Minimal fix plan
- Verification commands/tests
