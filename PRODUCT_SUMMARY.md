# Ledit: AI Software Development Assistant

Ledit is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into software development workflows. It acts as an assistant, automating and streamlining development tasks from code generation to complex feature orchestration.

## Key Features:

*   **Code Generation:** Generate new code, modify files, or fix bugs from natural language instructions. Ledit produces context-aware code.
*   **Feature Development:** Break down complex tasks into LLM-driven steps. Ledit can plan, execute, and validate multi-file changes, including environment setup and running tests.
*   **Context Awareness:** Incorporate project files, web search results, and user information into the LLM's context for accurate code suggestions.
*   **Interactive Problem Solving:** Engage in a conversational loop with the LLM to clarify requirements, resolve ambiguities, and refine solutions, especially with errors.
*   **Version Control Integration:** Track and commit changes to Git, with LLM-generated commit messages summarizing modifications.
*   **Extensible and Configurable:** Configure LLM providers, models, and settings to tailor Ledit.

## Summary:

Ledit helps developers work more efficiently by using AI to handle repetitive coding tasks, assist with complex problem-solving, and understand project context. It is an AI assistant that helps build software.
