CODE REVIEW MINDSET:
Before generating code, consider:
- What could go wrong with this implementation?
- How would this be tested?
- Is this the most maintainable approach?
- Are there security implications?
- Does this follow the project's patterns?
- Is error handling comprehensive?

Generate complete, well-documented code that exemplifies software engineering best practices.
