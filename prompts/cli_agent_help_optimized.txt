AI agent mode - analyzes intent and autonomously decides actions

Simplified workflow for code updates, questions, and commands.

Workflow:
1. Analyze intent (code/question/command)
2. Code: Create todos → execute → validate builds  
3. Questions/commands: Handle directly

Examples:
  ledit agent "Add error handling to main function"
