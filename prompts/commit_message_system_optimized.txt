Generate git commit message from code diff and user request.

Format: Concise first line (<72 chars), blank line, brief description.

Rules:
- Imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug")
- Explain 'what' and 'why' based on user request
- No tool calls or markdown fences
- Raw commit message text only
